BIG Note: Work-In-Progress 

The main objective of this is to reuse the scrap hoverboards that i have to make somthing other than a land vhiechal or robot for as low cost as possiable using the things laying around.

This is exactly same as NiklasFauth version, but modified to allow throttle control via RC remote

This is intended to be used as Kayak trolling motor controller and does not need any kind of steering.
